my topic is how insects could be a source of protein for animal feed and what is being done to reach this goal. I will cover the nutritional value of the insects, what they can replace in a ration, how they are processed, and who is already taking the first steps.


kinda give an overview of the whole paper.
  Call to action: watch for insect products to hit the market and consider adding them to your livestocks' ration.
  1. What: Insects as animal protein source
  2. Why: We need to more efficiently feed the world, because the population is growing rapidly.
  3. Whether: Farmers- they will understand the majority of the information, I will just need to define a few details in depth.
  4. How: Start insect farms, use them to replace other food items, use those other items for humans.
