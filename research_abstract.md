I will be researching how insects could be a source of protein for aminal feed. The insect meal could replace soybean and corn meal, allowing those products to be used for human consumption instead. There is quite a bit of research if this area. I have found a few companies that have already began to sell insects as a source of food. Some sources cover the nutritional value of various insects.
