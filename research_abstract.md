I will be researching how insects could be a source of protein for aminal feed and what is being done to reach this goal. A few insect farms that can be found here in the United States, but there is more intense research being conducted in other countries. Insect meal could possibly replace soybean and corn meal in animal rations, allowing those products to be used for human consumption instead. I have found a few companies that have already began to sell insects for feed. Some sources cover the nutritional value of various insects. While, other sources cover the regulations and current concerns regarding insects as a new source of protein.
