I will be researching how insects could be a source of protein for aminal feed. The insect meal could replace soybean and corn meal, allowing those products to be used for human consumption instead. There is quite a bit of research if this area. I have found a few companies that have already began to sell insects for food. Some sources cover the nutritional value of various insects. Other sources cover the regulations and current concerns regarding insects as a new source of protein.
